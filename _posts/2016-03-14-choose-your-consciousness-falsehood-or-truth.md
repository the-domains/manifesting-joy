# Choose Your Consciousness: Falsehood or Truth 

The emotions of scorn, hate, craving (which is desire), anxiety, regret, despair, blame and humiliation are all the consciousness of falsehood. 

Whereas, affirmation, trust, optimism, forgiveness, reverence, serenity **(which is joy)** and ultimately bliss are on the scale of consciousness called truth, as documented by Dr. David Hawkins. 

The gigantic lie that we have all been sold is that if we experience our desires, we will be happy. The sick thing is that is both right and wrong. The trap is this, we experience happiness and when we don't we experience unhappiness. Which then leads us to try harder, spend more money, compromise our values and manipulate, get angry and pull out all the stops in an effort to get our happiness fix. 

All this happens when we get hooked on chasing our desires. 
Consider this statement from the former Dean of Disney University... 
> 
> We do what we are. We are what we think. What we think is determined by what we learn. What we learn is determined by what we experience and what we experience is determined by what we expose ourselves to and what we do with that experience. - Mike Vance, Disney University

I have meditated on this statement for more than 20 years, the way interpret this statement is... 
Pay attention to what you do because the actions you take are mirrors of your experiences. Your experiences lead you to expose yourself and do things to ensure you experience your desires again and again. 

Then you end up learning that if you change the way you think you can get your happiness fix again. 
When you change your thinking, it changes the choices and actions you take. Which sets you on the endless loop of desire. We keep learning that certain things, produce certain results and experiences. Which leads you to the impermanent state of happiness over and over and over again. 

Once you get on the hamster wheel of happiness, around and around you go from one happiness/desire loop to another.
Eventually, the desire/happiness loop becomes toxic and you keep reinforcing our addiction to happiness and getting your desires fulfilled. 

The problem is desire is falsehood and like happiness is temporary, fleeting and impermanent. The experience of happiness is the manifestation of desire which only leads you to desire more. Round and round and round you go chasing after your desires.
