# How can I Manifest Joy!? 

Begin by paying attention to your appetites, think twice before indulging in your desires. 

* Ask yourself, what need am I feeding when I indulge this desire to feel happy? 
* What am I avoiding dealing with? 

The need to chase our desires gets triggered when we feel denied, disappointed and ultimately feed our cravings. 
Get present. 

So then how do you get present? 

The fastest path is through your breath.
Would you like two learn a very powerful breathing technique that will get you present within moments and connect you with your permanent Joy! state? 

This technique combines your breath your body and a visualization to complete the shift of energy and connect you with your permanent Joy state. 

## Close your eyes. 

The first part is to simply breathe in through your nose with your lips slightly parted. 

Notice and feel as you breathe in, your belly and chest expand. Breathe in, breathe out. Repeat, breathe in, breathe out. 

Next as as you breathe, place your tongue, on the roof your mouth touching your tongue to gums on the back of your top teeth. Then on your out breath, drop your tongue. 

Repeat and each time you breathe in, place your tongue on your gums just behind your top row of teeth. Then on the out breath release and drop your tongue. Do this until it feels effortless. 

In the final part of this meditation you will add a very powerful visualization. 

Keep breathing and using your tongue as before. This time, as you breathe in, imagine you are breathing straight through your chest into your heart. Imagine your breath going through your heart to your spine and rising up your spine into your skull and following the contour of your skull. Then when you feel the need to exhale, on the out breath, imagine the air exiting through your third eye, space between your eyebrows. 

Repeat this 6 - 12 times and when you are ready come back. 

People report a wide variety of benefits including feeling a movement of energy, a complete cessation of thought, to experiencing a calm, extreme present moment awareness to a quiet space of serene Joy!. 

I believe this is the place where we experience the Divine within and the space where Joy lives within. 
The more you use this technique the more effective it becomes. 
Eventually you will be able to do this breathing technique in meetings, with your eyes open and no one will ever know. It will support you to cope in extremely emotionally charged situations, use it to get present, experience your Joy state and many people report using it to fall asleep. 

I believe what you have just experienced using this Heart Joy! Breathing technique is your permanent Joy state and you can Manifest Joy! anytime by simply using this breathing technique.
