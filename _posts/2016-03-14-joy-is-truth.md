# Joy Is Truth ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/8e74fea9-b84e-4329-94ad-2a6efe6b4ac7.jpg)

Joy is a very high vibrational state of truth sandwiched between peace and love. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ff27bf50-4fbb-4ef2-bd2e-d823f06ca97e.jpg)

The experience of Joy is a feeling of being complete, a sense of oneness and serenity. It is one small and yet significant step away from the enlightened state. 

The levels of consciousness on the path to Manifesting Joy! are affirmation, trust, optimism, forgiveness, understanding, reverence, serenity (the joy state) and bliss. I don't know about you but that sure sounds better than humiliation, blame, despair, regret, anxiety, craving, hate and scorn.

> Will you choose the desire and happiness loop or the path that leads to joy, bliss, a sense of feeling complete and feeling at home in your own skin? 

Happiness and Joy are not created equal and we need to unhook ourselves and shift away from desire and the illusion of happiness. The time to move toward the path that leads to Manifesting Joy! is now.
