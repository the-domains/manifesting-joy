# Joy and Happiness are not created equal! ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/18d8bc4d-a836-4154-89c9-9cb0b1241af2.jpg)

Before we can begin Manifesting Joy! we must first understand the difference between happiness and joy! 

Joy is an energy you carry, happiness is something you experience.
The experience of happiness is fleeting and temporary. 

Joy always exists within and it is simply a matter of recognizing it stirring within and you can experience joy instantly. 

Many, many books have been written on the topic of happiness. There have been many extensive studies investigating how happiness affects your brain. I am not going to summarize them here because this is not a book about happiness. 

In fact, this book is the antithesis of all the books that have been written about happiness. Attempting to understand happiness is a waste of energy for an awakening soul.
Yet, for some reason we humans tend to want to understand topics which are nearly impossible to understand. Happiness is one of those topics. 

## The Problem With Happiness 

Just like happiness there is also unhappiness. 

There's a state of happiness we experience when we get something we desire. Or surprised when we receive something unexpected. Happiness is a natural outcome from the experience and fulfillment of something we desire. 

It is not commonly known or understood that desire is actually a very low vibrational state. 
In a state of desire, we are very vulnerable to suggestion, influence and manipulation. On the scale of consciousness, desire is only slightly higher than fear and just below anger. 

Pause for a moment and think about that, desire is trapped between our two most toxic emotions - fear and anger. 

Our desires lead us into all sorts of unhealthy choices and less than desirable habits. Some desires are so strong they become addictions and hold us hostage. We get disappointed when we don't experience our desires and when they are very strong. Desire can lead to significant cravings and when indulged repeatedly, lead us into enslavement and addiction.
